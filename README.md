# Medical IoT Sensor Data Simulator

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Medical Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data simulator. The simulator generates realistic medical sensor data for healthcare applications, research, and development purposes. It supports various medical sensors including heart rate monitors, blood pressure sensors, glucose monitors, accelerometers, and more.

The simulator can use real medical data from CSV files or generate synthetic data, making it perfect for testing healthcare IoT systems, medical data pipelines, and blockchain-based healthcare applications.

## Features
- **Real Medical Data Simulation**: Uses actual medical sensor data from CSV files (BVP, HR, ACC, EDA, Temperature, etc.)
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generates realistic medical sensor data when CSV files are not available
- **Medical Error States**: Simulates various medical sensor error conditions for realistic testing
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Sends data to Azure IoT Hub, MQTT brokers, or exports to CSV, XLSX, JSON
- **Healthcare-Focused UI**: Graphical user interface designed for medical sensor management
- **Blockchain Pipeline Ready**: Designed to support medical data blockchain pipelines with privacy features

## Medical Sensor Types Supported
- **ACC**: Accelerometer data (X, Y, Z orientation)
- **BVP**: Blood Volume Pulse measurements
- **Dexcom**: Interstitial glucose concentration
- **EDA**: Electrodermal activity
- **TEMP**: Skin temperature
- **IBI**: Interbeat interval
- **HR**: Heart rate
- **Food Log**: Nutritional intake data
- **SpO2**: Oxygen saturation
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic and diastolic measurements

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-iot-sensor-simulator
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd medical-iot-sensor-simulator
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Setting up Medical Data

1. **Place your CSV files** in the `medical_data/` directory:
   - `bvp_sample.csv` - Blood volume pulse data
   - `hr_sample.csv` - Heart rate data  
   - `acc_sample.csv` - Accelerometer data
   - Add other medical data files as needed

2. **CSV Format Requirements**:
   - **Single-value sensors** (BVP, HR, EDA, etc.): `Timestamp, Value`
   - **Accelerometer**: `Timestamp, X, Y, Z`
   - **Food Log**: `date, time_of_day, logged_food, calorie, total_carb, protein, total_fat`

### Running the Simulator

```bash
python setup_medical_sensors.py  # Setup medical sensors in database
python app/main.py               # Start the simulator
```

Access the simulator at `http://localhost:8080`

### Quick Demo

Run a quick demo to see the medical data simulation in action:

```bash
python demo_medical_simulation.py
```

### Configuration for Data Transmission

#### Sending Data to Azure IoT Hub

To send medical data to Azure IoT Hub, create an `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
IOT_HUB_CONNECTION_STRING=YourConnectionStringHere
IOT_HUB_PRIMARY_KEY=YourPrimaryKeyHere
IOT_HUB_SECONDARY_KEY=YourSecondaryKeyHere
```

#### Sending Data to MQTT Broker

For MQTT broker connectivity, add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS=YourBrokerAddressHere
MQTT_BROKER_PORT=YourBrokerPortHere
```
